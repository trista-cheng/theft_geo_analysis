This is the repository for course "Manufacturing Data Science," mainly for the final project of this course.
Only assignment 4 is stored in this repository.
The final project, theft analysis by geographical features, is partially stored here.
The whole project includes data augmentation, classification training, visualization, Django framework implementation.
The codes shown here are partial ones for data augmentation, classification, and visualization that are what I take over. 

## Theft analysis by geographical features

### Background & Objectives 
We may have "bias" towards some specific areas where we consider a theft may take place more likely. Somehow coincedently, those "theft hotspots" marked by local people are highly overlapped. We naively say these bias are proved by the reality at some level. Then, it is reasonable that a theft occurs with a highe probability in an area where some CERTAIN characteristics are satisfied. This project is try to extract and explain those characteristics.

### Challenge

Partial characteriscs may be easily perceived by humans, while partial ones may be hidden and beyond human brain's calculation ability. We had theft records with exact addresses. Location perception features by park
